# Statistical_Analysis_Car_Accidents_UK
The data about month-wise sum total figures of deaths of car drivers for the given period of fifteen years between 1969 and 1984 (16 years). Having taken into consideration the given statistics, a comprehensive characterization and comparison of data is summarized. The study is based on the assumption that data is normally distributed, which is reflected in the relevant statistical analysis in the form of a histogram. The report also has tested the hypothesis that proportion of deaths over the years is the same or not. Furthermore, we have tested whether the introduction of seatbelts in 1983 has been effective in decreasing the number of deaths.
