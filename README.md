The data about month-wise sum total figures of deaths of car drivers for the given period of fifteen years between 1969 and 1984 (16 years).
The study is based on the assumption that data is normally distributed, which is reflected in the relevant statistical analysis in the form of a histogram. 
The work captures:
1) Parametric and non-parametric estimation of Median of Deaths
2) Confindence interval for this estimate
3) Hypothesis testing:
  a) Proportion of deaths same or different over the years
  b) Distrubtion of data before and after the introduction of seat belt - whether the introduction of seatbelts in 1983 has been effective in decreasing the number of deaths.
We make important conclusion based on these hypothesis
